<tr><td>Abstract: In this talk, I will start from the simple example of x^2 + y^2 = 1 over Q (Pythagorean triple numbers) and look at the analogous problem of Hom_n(P^1,P^1) over k (Space of rational functions). </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td> This will be fun and we will see the idea of "global sections of sheaves over a global field" while reviewing classical works of V. Arnol’d, J. Milnor, M. Atiyah, G. Segal. We will work with motives (Cruder topology via Grothendieck ring of varieties) by the work B. Farb and J. Wolfson. </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>Afterward, we will review some basics on elliptic curves and consider the fact that each E/K corresponds to a K-rational point on the fine moduli stack Mbar_{1,1} of stable elliptic curves, which in turn corresponds to a rational curve on Mbar_{1,1}. We can ask what is the Mordell-Weil group E(K) for a given E/K and we will consider the question of boundedness of rank answered by the work of D. Ulmer. </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> 

<tr><td>In the end, I will explain the exact counting formula for all elliptic curves over k(t) via motivic methods along with a geometric explanation for the origin of lower order main terms based on the Height moduli framework (joint work with Dori Bejleri and Matthew Satriano). </td></tr>


Very basics on smooth 4-manifolds and algebraic surfaces

The classification of compact algebraic surfaces, which goes by the name of Enriques–Kodaira-Mumford-Bombieri classification, is a classical topic in AG.

Underlying each complex surface is a smooth 4-manifold which could have infinitely many pairwise distinct smooth structures. In practice, what we often do is to first pin down the exact homeomorphism type via application of Freedman’s Theorem.

In this talk, I will explain the Geography lattice and the problem of botany and how to go about figuring out the homeomorphism type via intersection forms.

P.S: By the remarkable work of Donaldson, every closed symplectic 4-manifold admits a structure of Lefschetz pencil, which can be blown up at its base points to yield a Lefschetz fibration i.e., understanding symplectic 4-manifolds is equivalent to understanding genus g Lefschetz fibrations over P^1.


Continuing from previous talk, we will explore how to go about constructing exotic 4-manifolds via topological surgeries: fiber sum and rational blowdown on Lefschetz fibrations, followed by checking its homeomorphism type and finally showing the resulting manifold is exotic via application of gauge theoretic smooth invariant distilled into characteristic classes, the Seiberg-Witten basic classes.
